## Description
Hello, and welcome to my portfolio website! I am a Graphic Design graduate from the University of Santo Tomas, pursuing my passion for Interactive Media Design at Fanshawe College. As a multimedia designer, I create unique, eye-catching designs that stand out.

You will find a showcase of my best works on this website, from branding and logo design to website design and development. My portfolio demonstrates my ability to create designs that are not only visually appealing but also functional and user-friendly.

I am in my third semester at Fanshawe College and am excited to share the projects I have been working on with you. I aim to use my skills and knowledge to create meaningful and impactful designs to help businesses and organizations achieve their goals.

Please feel free to take a look at my portfolio and contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss a potential project. Thank you for visiting my website!
